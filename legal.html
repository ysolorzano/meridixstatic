Meridix Terms of Service Agreement (TOS)

Updated June 19, 2017

1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS 

Meridix Creative, Inc. ("MERIDIX") provides service to you through the Meridix Platform ("PLATFORM") subject to the following Terms of Service Agreement ("TOS"), which may be updated by MERIDIX from time to time. In the event that the TOS changes, you can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: https://www.meridix.com/legal.  In addition, when using particular MERIDIX services, you and MERIDIX shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to those specific services which may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. MERIDIX may also offer other services that are governed by different Terms of Service agreements.

2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE

MERIDIX provides a comprehensive live streaming platform for sports teams, event producers, schools and educational institutions, businesses, and broadcasters through various software tools and website properties (the "Service"). You also understand and agree that the Service may from time to time include advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for MERIDIX to provide the Service. You also understand and agree that the service may include certain communications from MERIDIX, such as service announcements, administrative messages, and notifications of updates, and that these communications are considered part of MERIDIX membership and you will NOT be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that MERIDIX assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications. You are responsible for obtaining reliable access to the Service and you acknowledge that access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service fees or airtime charges). You are entirely responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of content through the Service. You must provide, and are responsible for, all equipment necessary to access the Service. In addition, user acknowledges unless otherwise stated by MERIDIX, events produced and disseminated under the Service could be viewed by anyone, anywhere.

3. CHARGES AND BILLING

The default Service is billed one time per month, except for cases where discounted terms are received for long-term contracts, and the period is measured from the date you purchase your subscription.  Rates for the month-to-month plans may vary, while rates for long-term contracts are locked in for the duration of each particular contract. You may obtain all information on current rates and surcharges for using the Service by going to https://www.meridix.com/pricing. By using the Service, user agrees to the following billing policies:

(a) For users on month-to-month plans: MERIDIX will bill the user the current monthly service rate in full at the start of each thirty-day billing period. We will charge your credit card the then-current monthly service rate at the beginning of each thirty-day billing cycle. Unless you notify MERIDIX otherwise, your subscription will automatically renew for additional thirty-day periods at the current monthly rate on the monthly anniversary of your subscription purchase date. No fractional month credits or refunds will be issued, except for service outages experienced by MERIDIX.  After the first thirty-day billing period, MERIDIX will continue to renew your subscription and charge your credit card the current monthly rate until you cancel, which you may do at any time. Once you cancel your subscription, your access will be automatically downgraded to the free plan at the end of the thirty-day billing cycle in which you submit your cancellation request.  All content, settings, files, and other data related to the account will then be subject to deletion after one year.  During each billing period, you will also be charged the then-current rate for any additional charges or other fees accumulated.

(b)For users on long-term contracts: MERIDIX will bill the user per the agreed upon term, rates, and payment schedule. No fractional month credits or refunds will be issued, except for service outages experienced by MERIDIX. During each billing period, you will also be charged the then-current rate for any additional charges or other fees accumulated.

(c)For users on the free plan: No charge is currently applied for users on free plans. However, you will be charged the then-current rate for any additional charges or other fees accumulated.

You are responsible for the full payment for use of the Service. You may use a major credit card, check, or other payment types (subject to MERIDIX approval) in order to submit payment for the Service. If you choose to use your credit card to pay for your use of the Service, you hereby authorize us to charge your credit card to pay your fees and store card information for automatic renewals. If you have selected a MERIDIX subscription that renews automatically, we will renew it automatically and will charge your credit card for the price of a then-current subscription to the Service. If you do not wish to use a credit card to pay for the Service, please contact us through our Customer Support system and other arrangements may be made.
